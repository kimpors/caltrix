## Overview

Site for matrix calculation, in this project i trying    
achieve like game view, i mean stylish  menus, tabs, etc.    
This project just for portfolio, so i don't think i stick    
along with it(if i ever did it -_-).

## Technology

For this site i use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)     
and [Catppuccin](https://tailwindcss.catppuccin.com/) (i think it's the best color palette)
